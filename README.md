# deep with cnn
 
In "pclub_logistic", I did the task by using only three libraries; numpy, pandas, matplotlib but it is giving wrong results. Since you told accuracy doesn't matter much as long as it shows my effort, hence I left that file as it is. 
 
I also made another file with name "pclub_logistic_alt", in which I used sklearn library which gives somewhat right results.
